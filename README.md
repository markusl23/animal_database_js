# Purpose of this repository:
The purpose of this repository currently is to offer a simple website, which serves as an app to retrieve animal data from a small external database.

- The app/page shows a list of animals
- Each animal on the list is a button
- Clicking on any of the animal buttons will show a modal
- For every animal, its modal will show the animal name, habitat, weight, food type and also an image of the animal
